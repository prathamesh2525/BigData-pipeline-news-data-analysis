# 🌐 News Analysis with Spark Word Count 📊  

## 🚀 Project Overview  

Welcome to the **News Analysis with Spark Word Count** project! 🎉  

This project analyzes news articles from multiple sources, processes the text with **Apache Spark**,  
and identifies the **most trending topics** based on word frequency.  
It helps uncover the hottest topics in the news world right now!  

### Here’s what this project does:  
- Uses **pre-collected (secondary) news data** instead of scraping.  
- Stores the dataset in **HDFS** (Hadoop Distributed File System).  
- Processes the data using **Apache Spark** to perform a **word count** (to identify trending topics).  
- Saves the results back to **HDFS** for easy access.  

Let’s analyze some news and discover the most discussed topics!
